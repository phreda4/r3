## History

I start with r4 in 2005, in 2020 I develop r3 with 64 bits and some internal diferences, more clear vm and some ideas, breaking r4 code, in 2021 I experiment with DLL linking more concise with 64 bits and remove all SO conecction (now are DLL calls), I think it is a real usefull version, but R3d4 (the prev version) has implementationfor WIN,LIN, RPI and MAX, this version can have this SO but need make all the connetion, not for now.
