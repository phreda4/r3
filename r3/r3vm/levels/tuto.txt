You need to control the robot, using %caCOMMANDS%c3.
To do this, you need to type this %caCOMMANDS%c3, in the %c6CODE%c3.
%s

: 2 step ;

%s
Here each word is a %caCOMMAND%c3.
%ca:%c3 indicates where to start executing.
%ca2%c3 stacks a 2.
%castep%c3 moves the robot in direction 2.
%ca;%c3 ends.
Press %i%cbF1%c3%i to execute the  %c6CODE%c3.
%w1

If you enter %c5NUMBERS%c3, they push in the %c6STACK%c3
Try entering 3 numbers.
*
Right.
to make calculations you have the commands + - * / remember to separate the commands with a space.
check that you can add by typing: %ca2 2 +%c3
The %c4+%c3 command takes 2 numbers from the %c6STACK%c3, adds them and saves the result.
*
Perfect.
execute the drop %c4COMMAND%c3
as you can see it removes the last number from the stack.
you can also duplicate the number with the dup command.
*
Good.
The step COMMAND takes a number from the STACK and according to this direction it advances one step, the direction according to the number corresponds to this table.

	7 0 1
	6   2
	5 4 3
	
enter the command 2 step to move the robot one step to the right.
*
Very well, try to reach the green x marked on the map
*
Perfect.
Sometimes you need to repeat COMMANDS many times, for this we are going to use LOOPS.
Try these commands
%c40 ( 10 <? 1 + ) drop%c3
*
The ( and ) enclose a set of commands, one of them is the CONDITIONAL, in this case it is <?
The number in the STACK is used to count the number of repetitions until the conditional is no longer fulfilled, in this case the question it asks is if the number is LESS than 10, that is, as long as it is less than 10 it will repeat the commands inside the parentheses.
Once the block ends, drop removes the number from the STACK.
Commands enclosed between ( and ) will be repeated as long as the condition is met.
*
We can add other commands inside the LOOP to repeat
%c40 ( 10 <? 1 + 2 step ) drop%c3
*
Some other conditionals are:
=? This command compares the two numbers in the STACK, removes the first one and is fulfilled when the numbers are equal
<? >? Checks if it is less or greater
Some conditionals do not remove the number from the stack, for example
0? is fulfilled when the number in the STACK is 0
1? is fulfilled when the number in the STACK is not 0
*
check COMMAND
*
IF conditional
*
TAKE command
LEAVE command
