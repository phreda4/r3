0 if no enemy in this angle.
 
0.1 scan 				| scan 0.2 angle
1.0 >? ( dup fire )		| fire if enemy is away more 1.0 distance
drop	
 

 batt	| -- bat

stack the battery level fro 0 to 1.0

 damage | -- dam

Numbers in fixed point

represent fractional par of unit

1.0 

+ - is the same

0.5 0.25 + 

*. /. is for fixed point

0.5 4.0 *.

you can convert

3 fix. -> 3.0

3.3 int. -> 3

you can mix operation

2.0 34 * 	34 2.0 * 
the result is fixed point

4.5 3 /
the result is fixed point
3 4.5 /

4.5 5 *.
the result is int

10.2 3 /.
the result is int
